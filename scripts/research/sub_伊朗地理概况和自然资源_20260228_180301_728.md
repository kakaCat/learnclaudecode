# SubAgent: 伊朗地理概况和自然资源

It appears that the web search functionality is currently not working properly, as all attempts to perform searches are returning errors. Without the ability to search or fetch online information, I cannot provide updated or detailed information about Iran's geography and natural resources.

However, based on general knowledge:

**Iran Geography Overview:**
- Iran is located in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey and Iraq to the west, Afghanistan and Pakistan to the east, the Caspian Sea to the north, and the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south.
- The country features diverse terrain, including mountain ranges (notably the Zagros and Alborz mountains), deserts (such as Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut), and coastal plains.
- The climate varies from arid or semi-arid in most regions to subtropical along the Caspian coast.

**Natural Resources:**
- Iran possesses significant reserves of fossil fuels—among the world’s largest proven reserves of oil and natural gas.
- Other natural resources include minerals such as copper, iron ore, zinc, chromium, and coal.
- Water scarcity is a growing concern due to uneven distribution and overuse of water resources.

For more accurate and up-to-date details, functional access to reliable sources like Encyclopaedia Britannica, CIA World Factbook, or official Iranian geological surveys would be necessary.
