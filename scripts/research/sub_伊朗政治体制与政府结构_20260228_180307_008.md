# SubAgent: 伊朗政治体制与政府结构

It seems there is a persistent issue with the web search tool returning errors. Given this limitation, I will provide a general overview of Iran's political system and government structure based on established knowledge:

Iran operates under a unique political system that blends elements of theocracy and democracy, established by the 1979 Islamic Revolution and outlined in its constitution.

**Key Features of Iran's Political System:**

1. **Supreme Leader (Rahbar):**
   - The highest authority in Iran, wielding significant power over all branches of government.
   - Appointed for life by the Assembly of Experts.
   - Controls the military, judiciary, state media, and appoints key officials, including the head of the judiciary and members of the Guardian Council.

2. **President:**
   - The second-highest-ranking official and head of government.
   - Elected by popular vote for a four-year term (maximum two consecutive terms).
   - Responsible for implementing the constitution and managing day-to-day governance, but subordinate to the Supreme Leader.

3. **Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis):**
   - A unicameral legislative body with 290 members elected by the public.
   - Drafts legislation, approves the national budget, and ratifies international treaties.
   - All candidates and legislation must be approved by the Guardian Council.

4. **Guardian Council:**
   - A 12-member body with significant oversight powers.
   - Six members are Islamic jurists appointed by the Supreme Leader; the other six are lawyers nominated by the head of the judiciary and approved by the Majlis.
   - Vets all candidates for elections and reviews legislation for compliance with Islamic law and the constitution.

5. **Assembly of Experts:**
   - An 88-member body of clerics elected by the public.
   - Tasked with appointing, supervising, and potentially dismissing the Supreme Leader.

6. **Judiciary:**
   - Headed by the Chief Justice, appointed by the Supreme Leader.
   - Interprets and applies Islamic law (Sharia) and ensures legal compliance with the principles of the Islamic Republic.

This hybrid system ensures that ultimate authority rests with religious leaders, particularly the Supreme Leader, while allowing limited democratic participation through elected institutions like the presidency and parliament.
