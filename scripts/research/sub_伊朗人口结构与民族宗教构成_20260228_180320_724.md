# SubAgent: 伊朗人口结构与民族宗教构成

It seems that the web search tool is currently encountering errors and unable to retrieve results. In this case, I will provide a general overview of Iran's population structure and ethnic-religious composition based on established knowledge up to 2024.

**Iran – Population Structure and Ethnic-Religious Composition**

**Population Overview:**
- Total population: Approximately 87–89 million (as of 2023–2024 estimates).
- Population growth rate: Around 1.3% annually in recent years, though declining due to urbanization and changing social norms.
- Age structure: Relatively young population, with about 60% under the age of 30, though aging is gradually increasing.
- Urbanization: Over 75% of Iranians live in urban areas, with major cities including Tehran (capital), Mashhad, Isfahan, Karaj, and Shiraz.

**Ethnic Composition:**
Iran is ethnically diverse, though the majority are Persian-speaking:
- **Persians**: ~61% – The largest ethnic group, primarily concentrated in central and southern Iran.
- **Azeris (Azerbaijanis)**: ~16% – Mainly in the northwest; speak Azerbaijani Turkish.
- **Kurds**: ~10% – Located in western Iran (Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Ilam provinces).
- **Lurs and Bakhtiari**: ~6% – Inhabit the Zagros Mountains region.
- **Arabs**: ~2% – Primarily in Khuzestan province near the Iraq border.
- **Baluch**: ~2% – Reside in southeastern Iran (Sistan and Baluchestan Province).
- **Turkmens, Qashqai, Armenians, Assyrians, Georgians, and others**: Smaller communities making up the remainder.

**Religious Composition:**
Iran is an Islamic Republic with Shia Islam as the state religion:
- **Shia Muslims (Twelver Ja'fari)**: ~90–95% – Official state religion; dominant in governance and public life.
- **Sunni Muslims**: ~5–10% – Primarily among Kurds, Baluch, Turkmens, and some Arabs.
- **Recognized religious minorities** (protected under the Constitution but with limited rights):
  - **Christians**: ~250,000–300,000 (mostly Armenian and Assyrian Orthodox, with small Protestant groups).
  - **Jews**: ~8,000–15,000 (one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world).
  - **Zoroastrians**: ~25,000–40,000 (followers of Iran’s pre-Islamic religion).
- **Unrecognized groups** (face legal and social challenges):
  - **Baha’is**: Estimated 300,000 – Not recognized by the state; subject to systematic persecution.
  - **Yarsanis (Ahl-e Haqq)**, **Sufis**, and other syncretic or mystical groups also exist but lack official recognition.

This demographic profile reflects Iran’s complex identity as a multi-ethnic, predominantly Shia Muslim nation with deep historical roots and significant cultural diversity.
